         <p> <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is a family recipe that's been made at Christmas time by at least 4 generations. This year will be the first for number 5!!! 'Bubba' brought it with her when she came from Lithuania.
               I pass it on in the true spirit of this season! </p> </p>
          <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <p> <ul>
            <li>1 cup butter </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
            <li>6 tablespoons confectioners' sugar </li>
            <li> 2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li> 1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
            <li> â…“ cup confectioners' sugar for decoration </li>
            </ul> </p> 
            <p><h2>Recipe</h2>
                <ol>
                  <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
                  <li>In a medium bowl, cream butter and vanilla until smooth. Combine the 6 tablespoons confectioners' sugar and flour; stir into the butter mixture until just blended. Mix in the chopped walnuts. Roll dough into 1 inch balls,
                    and place them 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.</li>
                  <li>Bake for 12 minutes in the preheated oven. When cool, roll in remaining confectioners' sugar. 
                      I also like to roll mine in the sugar a second time.</li>  
                </ol>
